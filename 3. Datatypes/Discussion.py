#What would you expect to be output by running the following examples?

#1
x = 1
y = 2
z = x + y
print (z)


#2
x = "1"
y = "2"
z = x + y
print (z)

#3
x = "1"
y = 2
z = x + y
print (z)

#4
x = 1.5
y = 2
z = x + y
print (z)

#5
x = "7"
y = "6"
x = int(x)
y = int(y)
z = x + y
print (z)

#6 - bit of a bonus question as haven't looked at conditionals yet! :)
